When fork () is called, two completely identical processes occur. All code after fork () is executed twice.
But the process-child inherits the position of the instruction pointer.
Then in the file with lines "printf("Hello"); fork();" we get output with double printing "Hello".
And in the file with lines "printf("Hello\n"); fork();" we get ouput with one "Hello".
